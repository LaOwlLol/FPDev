# FPDev
First Person Shooter Development for Unreal Engine 4.

# Simple Setup

1. Create a C++ UE4 'First Person' project template.  

    a. Name the project 'FPDev'
    
    b. Be sure to select the C++ tab in the new project wizard!
    
    c. Create the new project in a directory seperate from your Github projects directory.  Like an Unreal Projects directory or something... 

2. Clone This Git Project.

  - use the Git Desktop app.

  - Save this in a different location from the Unreal Projects directory. 
  
  - This will matter later. for now, both have the same name so Git Desktop will not let you clone in into your Unreal Projects folder. 
  
3. Copy the files in "Your Git Projects"/FPDev/Source/FPDev/ to "Your Unreal Projects"/FPDev/Source/FPDev/

  a. Copy all of them.
  
  b. Overwrite if needed. 
  
# Usage. 

1.  Do anything you want in the Unreal Project.

2.  For the time being do not save in the Git Project.

3.  Simple update only below.

# Simple Update

1.  Press "Sync" in Github Desktop then repeat step 3 above.

  - If all else fails delete Unreal Project directory and repeat simple Setup 1 and 3. (skip 2 you got the git right?)
