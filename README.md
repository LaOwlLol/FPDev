# FPDev
First Person Shooter Development for Unreal Engine 4.

# Simple Setup

1. Create a C++ UE4 'First Person' project template.  

    a. Name the project 'FPDev'
    
    b. Be sure to select the C++ tab in the new project wizard!
    
    c. Create the new project in Directory seperate from your Github Project directory for now.  Like a Unreal Projects Directory or something... 

2. Clone This Git Project.

  - Save this in a different location from the Unreal Projects Directory. 
  
  - This will matter latter they have the same name so Git Desktop will not let you clone in into your Unreal Projects folder. 
  
3. Copy the files in "Your Git Pojects"/FPDev/Source/FPDev/ to "Your Unreal Projects"/FPDev/Source/FPDev/

  a. Grab them all of them.
  
  b. Overwrite if needed. 
  
# Usage. 

1.  Do anything you want in the Unreal Project.

2.  For the time being do not saving the in Git Project. For the love of God do not push lololol

3.  Simple update only below.

# Simple Update

1.  Press "Sync" in Github Desktop then repeat step 3 above.

  - If all else fails delete Unreal Project directory and repeat simple Setup 1 and 3 (skip 2 you got the git right?)
